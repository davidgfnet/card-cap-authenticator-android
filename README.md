Here you can find the source for the Card Security Device app.

Playstore link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.davidgf.bankcap

This app allows users to use their Cards, Card reader and Phone/Tablet/Android Device to
generate challenge responses so that they can login in online banking, do transactions, etc.
So far the project works well for Postfinance using a USB reader (tested with ACR38U).

Still investigating how to improve it, since it seems to fail for other models such as
ACR39U for some unkown reason.

Feel free to contribute any patches, test your bank, etc!
